      - name: The donuts
        ingredients:
          - 2.5 dl milk
          - 30g fresh yeast
          - 50g granulated sugar
          - 2 large eggs
          - 90g butter
          - 1 tsp vanilla sugar
          - 500g all purpose flour
          - 0.5 tsp salt
          - Oil for frying
          - Sugar for sprinkling
        steps:
          - Pour the warm milk into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Or, if you do not own a stand mixer, a regular large mixing bowl. Sprinkle yeast and 1/2 teaspoon of the sugar on top of the milk. Give it a light stir with a spoon and allow to sit for 5 minutes. The mixture should be frothy after 5 minutes. If not, start over with new yeast.
          - If you do not have a mixer, you can mix by hand in this step. With the stand mixer running on low speed, add the remaining sugar, eggs, butter, vanilla, 2 cups of flour, salt, and nutmeg. Beat on low speed for 1 minute or until combined. Add remaining flour and beat on medium-high speed until the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl. The dough should be thick, yet soft. And slightly sticky. If it is too wet, add 2-3 more Tablespoons of flour. Make sure you do not add too much extra flour; you want a soft, slightly sticky dough.
          - Once doubled in size, punch down the dough to release any air bubbles. Remove dough from the bowl and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Punch down again to release any more air bubbles if needed. Roll the dough out until it is only 1/2 inch thick. Using a doughnut cutter, cut into 12 doughnuts. If you can’t quite fit 12, re-roll the scraps and cut more.
          - Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Place 6 doughnut and doughnut holes on each. Cover with kitchen towels and allow to rest for about 15-20 minutes as you prepare the oil. Place a cooling rack over a third baking sheet.
          - Pour oil into the pot set over medium heat. Heat to 375°F (191°C). Add 2-3 doughnuts at a time and cook for 1 minute on each side. Carefully remove with a metal spatula or metal slotted spoon. Wear kitchen gloves if oil is splashing. Place onto prepared rack. Repeat with remaining doughnuts, then turn off heat.* (See note for doughnut holes.)
      - name: Glaze
        optional: yes
        ingredients:
          - 5 dl icing sugar
          - 0.8dl cream
          - 0.5 tsp vanilla sugar
        steps:
          - Whisk all of the glaze ingredients together. Dip each warm doughnut (don’t wait for them to cool!) into the glaze, making sure to coat both sides. Place back onto prepared rack to allow excess glaze drip down. The glaze will eventually set + harden on the doughnuts after about 20 minutes.
      - name: Chocolate ganache
        optional: yes
        ingredients:
          - 200g dark chocolate
          - 1 spoonfull butter
          - 2dl full fat cream
        steps:
          - Place finely chopped chocolate into a heat-proof glass or metal bowl.
          - Heat cream on the stovetop until just simmering. If it’s boiling, the cream is too hot and could separate or even burn the chocolate. Once you see little simmers around the edges, turn off the heat and immediately pour the warm cream over the chocolate.
          - Let the two sit for a few minutes before stirring.
          - Stir until smooth.
          - After you stir the chocolate and warm cream together, use the ganache right away as a fruit dip or drizzle on top of cakes, cupcakes, pound cakes, ice cream, and more. But if you wait about 2 hours and let it cool completely, the ganache can be scooped with a spoon, spread onto desserts, or piped with piping tips.
