  - language: en
    yields: 1 pie for 10-12 people
    temperature: 175 C
    parts:
      - name: Crust
        ingredients:
          - 125g butter
          - 3 dl flour
          - 0.75 teaspoon salt
          - 0.5 dl ice water
        steps:
          - Mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Add the butter.
          - Using two forks, cut the butter and shortening into the mixture until it resembles coarse meal
          - Drizzle the cold water in, and do not add any more water than you need to.
          - Stop adding water when the dough begins to form large clumps.
          - Wrap each tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
          - When rolling out the chilled pie dough discs to use in your pie, always use gentle force with your rolling pin. Start from the center of the disc and work your way out in all directions, turning the dough with your hands as you go. Visible specks of butter and fat in the dough are perfectly normal and expected!
          - Fold the rolled out dough into a pie form and poke some holes in the bottom using a fork.
          - Precook in oven for 10-15 minutes.

      - name: Meringue topping
        ingredients:

          - 1-1.25 dl sugar
        steps:
          - In a large glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites until foamy. Add sugar gradually, and continue to whip until stiff peaks form.

          - Let sit for at least 1 hour in the fridge, or until the lemon curd has solidified. The filling might emit fluid during this stage, which is completely normal.
